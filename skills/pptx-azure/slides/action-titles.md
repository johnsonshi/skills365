# Action Titles: A Practical Guide

Action titles (also called headline titles or assertion titles) communicate the key takeaway of a slide in a single, declarative sentence. Instead of describing what a slide is about, an action title tells the audience what they should conclude from the information presented.

## What Are Action Titles?

An action title is a complete sentence that:

- States a conclusion, insight, or recommendation
- Can stand alone and convey meaning without seeing the slide content
- Answers the question "So what?" for the audience
- Drives the narrative forward

**The core principle**: If someone only reads your slide titles, they should understand the entire argument of your presentation.

## Topic Titles vs. Action Titles

Topic titles describe the subject matter. Action titles deliver the message.

| Topic Title (Avoid) | Action Title (Use) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Q3 Sales Results | Q3 Sales Exceeded Target by 15% |
| Customer Satisfaction Survey | Customer Satisfaction Dropped 12 Points After the Redesign |
| Market Analysis | Three Emerging Competitors Threaten Our Market Share |
| Implementation Timeline | Full Deployment Requires 18 Months and $2.4M Investment |
| Team Performance | Engineering Velocity Increased 40% After Adopting Sprints |
| Cost Breakdown | Infrastructure Costs Account for 60% of Total Spend |

Topic titles force your audience to figure out the point. Action titles do that work for them.

## The Consulting Approach

McKinsey, BCG, and other top consulting firms treat slide titles as the backbone of their communication. Their methodology follows specific principles:

### The "Headline Test"

Read only the slide titles in sequence. If the titles alone tell a coherent, persuasive story, your deck passes. If the titles read like a table of contents, revise them.

### One Message Per Slide

Each slide should make exactly one point. If you cannot summarize the slide in a single action title, split the slide or remove extraneous content.

### The "So What?" Discipline

After drafting a title, ask: "So what does this mean for the audience?" Keep refining until the title answers that question directly.

### Storyboarding with Titles First

Experienced consultants often write all slide titles before creating any content. This forces clarity of thinking and ensures logical flow before investing time in charts and analysis.

## Action Titles and the Pyramid Principle

Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle structures communication from conclusion to supporting evidence. Action titles implement this principle at the slide level.

```
Executive Summary (Main Argument)
    |
    +-- Action Title 1 (Supporting Point)
    |       |-- Data/Evidence
    |       |-- Analysis
    |
    +-- Action Title 2 (Supporting Point)
    |       |-- Data/Evidence
    |       |-- Analysis
    |
    +-- Action Title 3 (Supporting Point)
            |-- Data/Evidence
            |-- Analysis
```

Each action title is a "governing thought" that:

1. States the conclusion of that section
2. Is supported by the content below it
3. Connects logically to adjacent titles
4. Rolls up to support the overall argument

When your titles follow pyramid structure, audiences can:

- Grasp the argument at whatever level of detail they need
- Skip to sections relevant to them
- Remember your key points after the presentation

## Formula for Writing Action Titles

Use this pattern to transform topic titles into action titles:

### Step 1: Identify the Topic

What is this slide about?

*Example: "Cloud migration costs"*

### Step 2: State the Finding

What did you discover, conclude, or recommend?

*Example: "Cloud migration will cost $3.2M over three years"*

### Step 3: Add the Implication or Comparison

Why does this matter? How does it compare to alternatives or expectations?

*Example: "Cloud migration will reduce total infrastructure costs by 35% over three years"*

### Step 4: Make It Specific

Replace vague language with concrete numbers, timeframes, and outcomes.

*Example: "Migrating to AWS will save $1.8M annually starting in Year 2"*

### Sentence Structures That Work

- **[Subject] [verb] [specific outcome]**: "New pricing model increases margin by 8 points"
- **[Action] will [result] by [measure]**: "Consolidating vendors will reduce procurement costs by $400K"
- **[Finding] because [reason]**: "Customer churn spiked in Q2 because of the billing system outage"
- **[Recommendation] to [achieve goal]**: "Hire 12 engineers by Q3 to meet the product roadmap"
- **[Comparison]: [conclusion]**: "Build vs. buy analysis: Purchasing the platform saves 6 months"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Writing Questions Instead of Answers

- **Wrong**: "What drove the increase in customer complaints?"
- **Right**: "Shipping delays caused 70% of Q4 customer complaints"

Questions belong in your analysis process, not in your titles.

### 2. Using Vague Language

- **Wrong**: "Sales performance improved significantly"
- **Right**: "Sales grew 28% year-over-year, exceeding the 20% target"

Quantify whenever possible. "Significant," "substantial," and "considerable" communicate nothing.

### 3. Burying the Lead

- **Wrong**: "Analysis of customer segments reveals opportunities"
- **Right**: "Enterprise customers generate 3x the lifetime value of SMB customers"

State the specific insight, not the fact that insights exist.

### 4. Cramming Multiple Points

- **Wrong**: "Costs increased while quality improved and delivery times shortened"
- **Right**: Split into three slides, each with one clear action title

One slide, one point, one title.

### 5. Forgetting the Audience

- **Wrong**: "Neural network achieved 94.7% F1 score on validation set"
- **Right**: "New model correctly identifies 95% of fraudulent transactions"

Translate technical findings into business impact for non-technical audiences.

### 6. Making Titles Too Long

- **Wrong**: "Based on our comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape and market trends, we recommend pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy focused on the Asia-Pacific region"
- **Right**: "Expand to APAC to capture $200M untapped market opportunity"

Keep titles to one or two lines maximum. Move details to the slide body.

### 7. Using Passive Voice

- **Wrong**: "Cost reductions were achieved through process improvements"
- **Right**: "Process automation reduced operating costs by $2M annually"

Active voice is clearer and more direct.

### 8. Stating the Obvious

- **Wrong**: "Revenue comes from multiple sources"
- **Right**: "Subscription revenue now exceeds one-time sales for the first time"

If a title could apply to almost any company or situation, it is not specific enough.

## Practical Application

When revising existing slides:

1. Cover the slide content and read only the title
2. Ask: "Does this tell me what to think or believe?"
3. If not, look at the slide content and identify the single most important takeaway
4. Rewrite the title as a declarative sentence stating that takeaway
5. Verify the slide content supports the new title (remove content that does not)

When creating new slides:

1. Write the action title first
2. Ask: "What evidence do I need to prove this statement?"
3. Include only that evidence on the slide
4. If you cannot find supporting evidence, reconsider the title

## Summary

Action titles transform presentations from information dumps into persuasive arguments. They respect your audience's time by communicating conclusions directly, and they force you as the presenter to clarify your own thinking.

The investment in writing strong action titles pays off in:

- Clearer communication
- More memorable presentations
- Faster executive alignment
- Documents that work asynchronously (when you are not there to explain them)

Every slide title is an opportunity to advance your argument. Use it.
