## 1. Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle

The Pyramid Principle, developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey, is the foundation of executive communication. The core idea: **lead with the answer, then provide supporting evidence**.

### The Structure

```
                    [Main Point / Recommendation]
                              |
            +-----------------+-----------------+
            |                 |                 |
    [Supporting Arg 1]  [Supporting Arg 2]  [Supporting Arg 3]
            |                 |                 |
        [Data/Evidence]   [Data/Evidence]   [Data/Evidence]
```

### How to Apply It

**Wrong approach (bottom-up):**
- "We analyzed market data..."
- "Customer surveys showed..."
- "Competitor analysis revealed..."
- "Therefore, we recommend expanding into Europe."

**Right approach (top-down):**
- "We should expand into Europe. Here's why:"
- "Market opportunity is $2B with 15% growth"
- "Customer demand validated through 500 surveys"
- "Competitors are under-serving this segment"

### Practical Tips

1. **Write your conclusion first** - Before building any slides, write down your recommendation in one sentence.
2. **Test with the "elevator pitch"** - If you had 30 seconds with the CEO, what would you say? That's your opening.
3. **Group supporting points in threes** - Three arguments are memorable; seven are not.
4. **Each supporting point should be able to stand alone** - If challenged on one, the others should still support your conclusion.

## 2. MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

MECE ensures your analysis is complete and non-overlapping. Executives will immediately spot gaps or redundancies.

### What It Means

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between categories. Each item belongs in exactly one bucket.
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities are covered. Nothing is left out.

### Examples

**MECE breakdown of revenue:**
- Product A revenue
- Product B revenue
- Product C revenue
- Services revenue

**Non-MECE breakdown (problematic):**
- Enterprise sales (overlaps with product categories)
- Product A revenue
- North America revenue (overlaps with everything)
- New customer revenue (overlaps with all above)

### Common MECE Frameworks

| Framework | Categories |
|-----------|------------|
| Geography | North America, Europe, APAC, LATAM, MEA |
| Customer Segment | Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB, Consumer |
| Time | Past, Present, Future |
| Source | Internal, External |
| Type | Fixed, Variable |
| Control | Within our control, Outside our control |

### How to Verify MECE

1. **List all items in your analysis**
2. **Check for overlaps** - Can any item fit in multiple categories?
3. **Check for gaps** - Is there anything you're missing?
4. **Ask "what else?"** - Keep asking until you can't add anything

---

## 3. The "So What?" Test

Every slide must answer the question "So what?" If it doesn't, cut it or reframe it.

### The Test in Practice

For each slide, ask:
1. **So what?** - Why does this matter?
2. **What should we do about it?** - What action does this imply?
3. **Why should the executive care?** - How does this connect to their priorities?

### Before and After Examples

**Slide title (before):** "Q3 Sales Performance"

**So what?** It tells me nothing actionable.

**Slide title (after):** "Q3 Sales Exceeded Target by 12%, Driven by Enterprise Segment"

---

**Slide title (before):** "Customer Survey Results"

**So what?** I don't know if the results are good or bad.

**Slide title (after):** "78% of Customers Would Recommend Us - Up 15 Points YoY"

---

### Action-Titled Slides

Transform every slide title from a topic label to a takeaway statement:

| Topic Label (Weak) | Takeaway Statement (Strong) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Market Analysis | Market Share Declined 3% Due to New Entrant |
| Financial Overview | Margins Are Sustainable at Current Pricing |
| Competitive Landscape | We Lead in Features but Lag in Price Perception |
| Team Update | Engineering Headcount Gap Threatens Q4 Delivery |

---

## 4. Executive Attention Spans

Research suggests executive attention is front-loaded. Structure your presentation accordingly.

### The Attention Curve

```
Attention
    ^
100%|****
    |    ****
    |        ****
    |            ********
    |                    ****
    |                        ****____
    +---------------------------------> Time
    0    5    10   15   20   25   30 min
```

### Practical Implications

1. **Minutes 1-5: Maximum impact zone**
   - State your recommendation
   - Present the executive summary
   - Flag any decisions needed

2. **Minutes 5-15: Supporting detail**
   - Walk through key evidence
   - Address anticipated objections
   - Show critical data

3. **Minutes 15-30: Deep dive (if needed)**
   - Detailed analysis
   - Edge cases
   - Implementation specifics

### Structural Rules

- **Put the ask in the first 3 slides** - Don't save the request for the end
- **Front-load bad news** - Executives hate surprises at the end
- **Design for interruption** - Assume you might only get 5 minutes
- **Number your slides** - Enables easy reference ("Go back to slide 4")

---

## 5. SCR Framework (Situation, Complication, Resolution)

SCR provides a narrative structure that executives find compelling and easy to follow.

### The Components

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish shared context | "We launched Product X in Q1 to capture the mid-market segment" |
| **Complication** | Introduce the tension or problem | "Adoption is 40% below forecast, and churn is increasing" |
| **Resolution** | Present your recommendation | "We should reposition for enterprise and sunset the SMB tier" |

### SCR in Practice

**Full Example:**

**Situation:** "Six months ago, we entered the European market with localized versions of our three core products. Initial projections estimated $10M in Year 1 revenue based on market analysis and partner commitments."

**Complication:** "We've achieved only $2M in revenue through Q2. The primary issues are: (1) regulatory requirements we underestimated, (2) a key partner's acquisition by a competitor, and (3) pricing that's 30% above local alternatives."

**Resolution:** "We recommend a revised strategy: obtain certifications by Q4, sign two new channel partners, and introduce a region-specific pricing tier. This positions us for $8M in Year 2 with a path to profitability by Year 3."

### When to Use SCR

- Board presentations
- Investment requests
- Strategy recommendations
- Project status updates with issues
- Any presentation where you need buy-in

## 6. Structuring an Executive Summary Slide

The executive summary slide is often the only slide that gets full attention. Make it count.

### Essential Elements

1. **Headline** - Your main recommendation or conclusion in one sentence
2. **Context** - 1-2 sentences on why this matters now
3. **Key Points** - 3-5 bullet points supporting your headline
4. **The Ask** - What decision or action you need from the audience
5. **Timeline** - When a decision is needed

### Template Structure

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                    |
| [HEADLINE: One-sentence recommendation or conclusion]              |
|                                                                    |

| Investment Required: [If applicable - dollars, headcount, time]    |
|                                                                    |

## 7. Anticipating Questions and Backup Slides

Executives will challenge your assumptions. Prepare for it.

### Common Executive Questions

| Question Type | Example | How to Prepare |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Financial | "What's the ROI?" | Have NPV, payback period, sensitivity analysis |
| Risk | "What could go wrong?" | Prepare risk matrix with mitigations |
| Alternatives | "What else did you consider?" | Show options you evaluated and why you rejected them |
| Precedent | "Has this worked before?" | Have case studies or analogies ready |
| Timeline | "Why so long/short?" | Show detailed project plan with dependencies |
| Resources | "What do you need from us?" | Specific asks with clear ownership |

### Structuring Backup Slides

1. **Place after your "Thank You" or "Discussion" slide**
2. **Number them clearly** (e.g., "Backup 1", "Backup 2" or "B1", "B2")
3. **Organize by topic** for quick navigation
4. **Include slide titles as questions** (e.g., "What are the key risks?")

### Recommended Backup Slides

- Detailed financial model and assumptions
- Full competitive analysis
- Risk register with probability and impact
- Detailed timeline / Gantt chart
- Team org chart and responsibilities
- Technical architecture (if relevant)
- Methodology explanation
- Raw data or detailed survey results
- Glossary of terms (for technical topics)

### Pro Tips

- **Rehearse navigating to backups** - Know exactly where each one is
- **Anticipate the top 5 questions** - Have a backup slide for each
- **Cross-reference in main slides** - "See Backup 3 for detailed assumptions"
- **Keep backup slides updated** - Stale data destroys credibility

## 8. Read-Ahead Decks vs. Presentation Decks

These serve different purposes and require different designs.

### Read-Ahead Decks (Pre-Read / Leave-Behind)

**Purpose:** To be consumed independently, without a presenter

**Characteristics:**
- Self-explanatory with complete sentences
- More text per slide (readable paragraphs)
- Detailed annotations on charts
- Comprehensive footnotes and sources
- Can stand alone as a document

**When to Use:**
- Sending materials before a meeting
- Board books
- Documents that will be forwarded
- Regulatory or compliance submissions

**Design Principles:**
- Assume no verbal explanation
- Include context that would normally be spoken
- Use complete sentences, not fragments
- Cite all sources

### Presentation Decks (Talking Decks)

**Purpose:** To support a live presenter

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal text (keywords and phrases)
- Large fonts (24pt minimum)
- Visual emphasis on images and charts
- Speaker does the explaining
- Audience focuses on presenter, not reading

**When to Use:**
- Live presentations
- Video conferences where you're sharing screen
- Town halls and all-hands meetings

**Design Principles:**
- If they can read it faster than you can say it, there's too much text
- One idea per slide
- Slides are visual aids, not scripts
- Use presenter notes for your talking points

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Read-Ahead | Presentation |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Text density | High | Low |
| Font size | 10-14pt acceptable | 24pt minimum |
| Sentences | Complete | Fragments/bullets |
| Charts | Detailed annotations | Clean, simple |
| Standalone | Yes | No |
| Slide count | More slides acceptable | Fewer, focused |

### Hybrid Approach

For important presentations, create both:
1. **Send read-ahead** 24-48 hours before
2. **Present with talking deck** in the meeting
3. **Leave behind the read-ahead** for reference

## 9. Amazon's 6-Pager Philosophy

Amazon famously banned PowerPoint in favor of narrative memos. Understanding this approach offers valuable contrast.

### The Amazon Approach

- **6-page narrative memo** written in complete sentences and paragraphs
- **No bullet points** - Forces clear thinking
- **Read silently** at the start of meetings (20-30 minutes)
- **Discussion follows** the reading

### Jeff Bezos's Reasoning

> "The reason writing a 'good' 6-page memo is harder than 'writing' a 20-page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what."

### 6-Pager Structure

1. **Introduction** - Context and purpose
2. **Goals** - What success looks like
3. **Tenets** - Principles guiding the approach
4. **State of the Business** - Current situation with data
5. **Lessons Learned** - What we've discovered
6. **Strategic Priorities** - Recommended actions

### When to Use Narrative Over Slides

| Use Narrative (6-Pager) | Use Slides |
|------------------------|------------|
| Complex strategic decisions | Quick status updates |
| New product proposals | Visual/data-heavy content |
| Deep analysis required | Large audience presentations |
| Need rigorous thinking | External stakeholders expect it |
| Time for reading in meeting | No time for pre-reading |

### Applying Amazon's Philosophy to Slides

Even if you use slides, apply the narrative discipline:
- **Write out your argument first** as prose before making slides
- **Ensure logical flow** between slides (not just a collection of points)
- **Test readability** - Could your deck be understood without you?
- **Question every bullet** - Is this the clearest way to express this?

## 10. McKinsey/BCG Consulting Communication Style

Consulting firms have refined executive communication over decades. Here are their core principles.

### The McKinsey Way

**Governing Thought:** Every presentation has one central theme that everything supports.

**Pyramid Structure:**
- Start with the answer
- Group arguments logically
- Support with facts

**Action Titles:** Every slide title is a complete sentence stating the slide's takeaway.

### Key Techniques

**1. The Ghost Deck / Ghosting**
- Create slide titles only first
- Read through titles in sequence
- They should tell a complete story without content
- If the story doesn't flow, restructure before adding content

**2. Dot-Dash Structure**
- Bullet points (dots) are main points
- Sub-bullets (dashes) provide evidence or detail
- Never go more than two levels deep

**3. Exhibit Design**
- Charts have action titles ("Revenue grew 15%," not "Revenue")
- Source everything
- Keep visual complexity low

### BCG Additions

**The One-Page Summary:** Every workstream produces a single page that captures the full story.

**Hypothesis-Driven:** Start with an answer and test it, rather than boiling the ocean.

**80/20 Analysis:** Focus on the vital few, not the trivial many.

### Consulting Slide Structure

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [ACTION TITLE: Complete sentence stating the takeaway]            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                    |
|   +------------------+              Key Insights:                  |
|   |                  |              - Point 1 with data            |
|   |   [CHART or      |              - Point 2 with data            |
|   |    VISUAL]       |              - Point 3 with data            |
|   |                  |                                             |
|   +------------------+              Implications:                  |
|   Source: [Citation]                - What this means              |
|                                     - What we should do            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Communication Hierarchy
