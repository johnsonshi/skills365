# One Idea Per Slide: A Practical Guide

## The Core Principle

Every slide in your presentation should communicate exactly one idea, one message, or one key takeaway. This is not about limiting content but about structuring it for maximum impact and comprehension.

**The rule:** If you cannot summarize a slide's message in one clear sentence, the slide contains too many ideas.

This principle is foundational to consulting presentations (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) and has been popularized in design-focused approaches like Garr Reynolds' *Presentation Zen*.

## Why It Matters

### Cognitive Load
- Human working memory can hold approximately 4 items at once (Cowan's research)
- Each additional idea on a slide competes for limited attention
- Audiences cannot read, listen, and process multiple concepts simultaneously

### Retention
- Single-idea slides are remembered 40% better than cluttered slides
- The brain encodes information more effectively when presented sequentially
- Clear slides create "memory hooks" that audiences can recall later

### Clarity
- Ambiguity increases when multiple ideas share visual space
- Audiences guess which point matters most when given too many options
- Presenters lose control of the narrative when slides contain competing messages

### Presenter Confidence
- Speaking to one point is easier than juggling multiple threads
- Q&A becomes more focused and manageable
- Timing is easier to control with predictable slide density

## How to Identify If You Have Too Many Ideas

### The "So What" Test
Ask yourself: "What is the one thing I want the audience to remember from this slide?" If you struggle to answer or give multiple answers, the slide needs splitting.

### Warning Signs

**Title Problems:**
- Your slide title contains "and" (e.g., "Market Growth and Competitive Threats")
- The title is vague or generic (e.g., "Overview" or "Key Points")
- You need a subtitle to clarify the title

**Content Problems:**
- More than 5-7 bullet points on a single slide
- Bullet points at multiple levels of hierarchy (sub-bullets of sub-bullets)
- Two or more distinct charts or data visualizations
- Text blocks competing with visuals for attention

**Delivery Problems:**
- You spend more than 2-3 minutes on a single slide
- You find yourself saying "also on this slide" or "another point here"
- Audience questions reveal confusion about which point to focus on

### The Squint Test
Step back and squint at your slide. If you cannot immediately identify the single focal point, the slide is too busy.

## Techniques to Split Complex Slides

### 1. The Vertical Split
Transform a slide with multiple bullet points into a sequence of slides, each with one bullet as the headline.

**Before:** One slide titled "Recommendations" with six bullet points

**After:** Six slides, each with one recommendation as the title and supporting evidence in the body

### 2. The Build Sequence
If ideas must be shown together for context, use a build sequence:
- Slide 1: First idea alone
- Slide 2: First idea (dimmed) + second idea (highlighted)
- Slide 3: Summary showing both ideas together

### 3. The Summary-Then-Detail Pattern
- Lead with a summary slide showing all components at a high level
- Follow with individual slides diving deep into each component
- Close with the summary slide again to reinforce the structure

### 4. The Data Extraction Method
For slides with multiple charts:
- Extract each chart to its own slide
- Write an insight headline for each chart
- Add a synthesis slide that draws conclusions across the data

### 5. The Assertion-Evidence Split
- Slide 1: State your assertion as the headline
- Slide 2: Present the evidence (chart, data, example)
- This is the standard McKinsey approach

## Examples of Good vs Bad

### Example 1: Market Analysis

**Bad Slide:**
- Title: "Market Overview"
- Content: Four bullet points covering market size, growth rate, key competitors, and regulatory environment
- Visual: Two pie charts (market share and segment breakdown)
- Problem: Five distinct ideas competing for attention

**Good Approach:**
- Slide 1: "The market has grown 15% annually for three consecutive years" with a single line chart
- Slide 2: "Three players control 70% market share" with one pie chart and company logos
- Slide 3: "New regulations will reshape competition in 2025" with a timeline of regulatory changes

### Example 2: Recommendations

**Bad Slide:**
- Title: "Recommendations"
- Content: Six bullet points listing different strategic initiatives
- Problem: The audience cannot prioritize or remember any single recommendation

**Good Approach:**
- Slide 1: "We recommend three strategic initiatives" with a visual showing the three options
- Slide 2: "Initiative 1: Expand into Southeast Asia" with supporting rationale
- Slide 3: "Initiative 2: Acquire TechCo for AI capabilities" with supporting rationale
- Slide 4: "Initiative 3: Restructure sales organization" with supporting rationale
- Slide 5: Summary showing expected impact of all three initiatives combined

### Example 3: Financial Results

**Bad Slide:**
- Title: "Q3 Financial Results"
- Content: Revenue figure, profit margin, year-over-year comparison, regional breakdown, and outlook for Q4
- Visual: Table with twelve cells of data
- Problem: The audience does not know which number matters most

**Good Approach:**
- Slide 1: "Revenue exceeded target by 12%" with single revenue figure prominently displayed
- Slide 2: "North America drove the outperformance" with regional breakdown chart
- Slide 3: "We project continued momentum in Q4" with forward-looking estimate

## Consulting Style References

### McKinsey Approach
- Every slide has an "action title" that states the key message as a complete sentence
- The body of the slide exists only to support the title's assertion
- If the title does not stand alone, the slide is not ready
- Executives should be able to read only the titles and understand the full argument
- See also: [action-titles.md](action-titles.md) for detailed guidance

### The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)
- Developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey
- Start with the answer, then provide supporting evidence
- Each slide represents one node in a logical pyramid
- Supporting points should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE)
- See also: [executive-communication.md](executive-communication.md) for detailed coverage

### Garr Reynolds' Presentation Zen
- Embrace simplicity and white space
- "Reduce to the essence" by removing everything non-essential
- Think of slides as billboards: one message, instantly understood
- Let visuals breathe; avoid the temptation to fill empty space

## Practical Checklist

Before finalizing any slide, verify:

- [ ] The slide title states a complete thought or assertion
- [ ] You can summarize the slide's message in one sentence
- [ ] There is only one chart, graph, or data visualization
- [ ] All content directly supports the single message
- [ ] You can present the slide in under two minutes
- [ ] Removing any element would hurt comprehension (nothing is decoration)

## When to Break the Rule

The one-idea-per-slide principle has valid exceptions:

1. **Comparison slides:** When explicitly comparing two options, showing them side-by-side can be more effective than sequential slides
2. **Summary slides:** Agenda or recap slides that list multiple items for navigation purposes
3. **Dashboard views:** When the audience specifically needs to see multiple metrics at once (rare in persuasive presentations)

Even in these cases, ensure the slide's purpose is crystal clear and the audience knows what to focus on.
