# Less Is More: A Practical Guide to Slide Minimalism

Effective presentations communicate ideas clearly and memorably. The biggest obstacle to clarity is clutter. This guide provides practical strategies for ruthlessly cutting unnecessary content from your slides.

---

## The Core Principle: Ruthless Editing

Every element on your slide must earn its place. If it does not directly support your message, remove it.

Ask yourself for each piece of content:
- Does this help my audience understand the key point?
- Would removing this hurt comprehension?
- Is this information or decoration?

**The rule**: When in doubt, cut it out.

## The 10/20/30 Rule

Guy Kawasaki, venture capitalist and former Apple evangelist, popularized a simple framework for presentations:

| Element | Limit | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Slides | 10 | No one can absorb more than 10 concepts in a single sitting |
| Minutes | 20 | Allows time for setup, questions, and discussion in a 1-hour slot |
| Font Size | 30pt | Forces you to use fewer words; ensures readability |

The 30-point font rule has a secondary benefit: it prevents you from reading your slides verbatim. If you cannot fit your point in 30pt text, you are trying to say too much on one slide.

## Why Walls of Bullet Points Fail

Slide decks filled with bullet points create several problems:

**Cognitive overload**: Audiences cannot read and listen simultaneously. When you show dense text, they stop listening to you.

**False comprehension**: Presenters mistake "showing information" for "communicating information." Bullet points on a screen do not equal understanding in the audience's mind.

**Monotony**: Slide after slide of bullets creates visual fatigue. Audiences disengage.

**The teleprompter trap**: Dense slides tempt presenters to read from them, destroying eye contact and engagement.

A slide is not a document. A slide is a visual aid.

## The Billboard Test

Imagine your slide displayed on a highway billboard. A driver has approximately 3 seconds to glance at it. Can they grasp the main point?

**How to apply the test**:

1. Display your slide
2. Look away for 3 seconds
3. Look at the slide for exactly 3 seconds
4. Look away again
5. Can you recall the single main point?

If the answer is no, simplify until the answer is yes.

This test reveals:
- Too much text
- Unclear hierarchy
- Missing visual focus
- Competing elements

## Techniques for Reducing Text

### Convert to Visuals

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| A paragraph describing a process | A flowchart or diagram |
| Statistics listed as bullet points | A chart or graph |
| A list of comparisons | A table or side-by-side visual |
| Step-by-step instructions | Numbered icons or a timeline |

### Use Speaker Notes

Move supporting details, statistics, sources, and elaboration into your speaker notes. The audience sees the simple slide; you see the complete information.

Speaker notes are your script. Slides are your visual aid.

### Split Slides

One idea per slide. If you have three points, consider three slides instead of three bullets on one slide. Slides are free. Attention is expensive.

### The "So What?" Filter

For every piece of text, ask "So what?" If the audience would not care about this detail, remove it.

## Slide vs. Handout: When to Use Each

Not everything belongs on a slide. Use this decision framework:

### Keep on the Slide

- The single key message
- Simple visuals that support your spoken words
- Data visualizations that require explanation
- Images that create emotional impact

### Move to a Handout or Appendix

- Detailed data tables
- Long quotations
- Technical specifications
- Source citations and references
- Background information for context
- Complex diagrams that require study
- Material for follow-up reading

Tell your audience: "The detailed breakdown is in your handout. Let me show you the key insight."

This approach:
- Keeps slides clean
- Gives audiences reference material
- Demonstrates thoroughness without cluttering the presentation

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio

Borrowed from engineering, the signal-to-noise ratio measures useful information against irrelevant information.

**Signal**: Content that directly communicates your message
**Noise**: Everything else

Common sources of noise in slides:
- Decorative clip art
- Unnecessary logos on every slide
- Gratuitous animations
- Redundant labels
- Excessive gridlines on charts
- Text that restates what the visual already shows

**To improve your ratio**:

1. Identify the signal (your core message)
2. Identify every other element on the slide
3. For each element, ask: "Does this amplify the signal or create noise?"
4. Remove the noise

A high signal-to-noise ratio means every element on the slide serves the message.

## Practical Checklist

Before finalizing any slide, verify:

- [ ] Can someone understand the point in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is the font size at least 30pt for body text?
- [ ] Does the slide contain only ONE main idea?
- [ ] Have I moved supporting details to speaker notes?
- [ ] Is every visual element necessary?
- [ ] Would this pass the billboard test?
- [ ] Have I removed all decorative noise?

## Further Reading

For deeper exploration of slide minimalism and presentation design:

**Presentation Zen** by Garr Reynolds
- Core philosophy: Simplicity, restraint, and naturalness
- Key concept: Slides should be visual aids, not documents
- Emphasis on storytelling and audience connection
- Practical examples of transforming cluttered slides into clean designs

Reynolds draws on Zen aesthetics to argue that empty space is not wasted space. Restraint in design creates focus. Every element you remove makes the remaining elements stronger.

## Summary

The path to better slides is subtraction, not addition.

1. Apply the 10/20/30 rule as a starting constraint
2. Use the billboard test to verify clarity
3. Move details to speaker notes and handouts
4. Maximize signal, eliminate noise
5. One idea per slide

Your slides exist to support your message, not to be your message. Let the slides breathe. Let the audience think. Let your words do the work.
